I made two extra additional pages and two additional css pages. 

1. caramelglazing.html and caramelglazing.css

This shows how the dropdown bar of glazing options on a specific product page looks. Users can view four possible glazing options in a dropdown menu. 


2. carameladded.html and carameladded.css

This shows the state where users have picked both the glazing as well as quantity and added the product to the cart. The picked glazing and quantity is reflected in a different font color (#8B6140) which is consistent with the color palette of the website. The “Add to Cart” button changes to “Added to Cart”. The color also changes to a darker brown. These indicates a different status. There is also a number reflected beside the navigation option of “cart” to provide the reaffirmation to users that the product has been successfully added to cart, as well as the total quantity of products they have in their cart.
