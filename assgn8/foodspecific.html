          <p>Ladurée is absolutely gorgeous. It is a Parisian pastry and cake shop that aims to bring the authentic French experience to customers. My pictures don't do it very much justice, but it was one of the most breathtaking restaurants I've ever been too. Upon entry, you're greeted by the wonderful scent of fresh macarons and pastry and the incredibly beautiful aesthetics  of both the restaurant as well as the food. It was October, a really nice day out, not too warm and not too cold, so we got the chance to sit outside. We got seated at a cute little marble table, surrounded by flowers and greenery. I'm pretty sure we spent at least a solid five minutes appreciating and being wowed by the aesthetics. There was also a bridal shower going on (honestly the perfect place for it)! <p>

          <p>We had a hard time deciding what to eat - everything on the menu looked so good I wanted to try everything! In the end, I settled for the Smoked Salmon Benedict Eggs ($17), Kristy settled for the Bacon Benedict Eggs ($15) and Carolyn settled for the Crispy Bacon French Toast ($15). We also each got a drink - I got a Rose Latte ($7). They gave us this amazing tasting bread while waiting - we were so impressed. Everything we ordered was just so delicious. We heard incredibly good things about the pastries and macarons there so we had to give them a try! </p>

          <p>This place is definitely on the pricier side, but I would say that the food, vibes and aesthetics make it all worth it. It ain't super wallet-friendly for a college student especially, but it makes for a perfect treat once in a while. I am definitely going to visit again when I'm back in nyc, just to try out the other things on the menu! </p>
