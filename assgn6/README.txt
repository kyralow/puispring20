In "New Shopping Cart Page", I included lofi sketches and a hifi mockup of the shopping cart page.

From products.html, clicking on the picture of "Caramel Pecan" brings users to the specific product page. After selecting glazing and quantity from the dropdown menus and adding it to cart, the "Add to cart" button changes to "Added to cart" and a number is reflected beside the word "cart" in the nav bar to show that the product has been successfully added to cart. Changes are also reflected accordingly in the shopping cart.

Only the product "Caramel Pecan" is clickable now.
